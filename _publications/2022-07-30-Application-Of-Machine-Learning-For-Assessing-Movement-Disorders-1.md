Although it is not a officially published work, while at the New Jersey Governor's School for Sciences I collaborated on a paper about using ML to detect walking irregularities. I was responsible for the majority of the data and ML code.

I have a fork of the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/patrickDugan04/walking-irregularity-detection)
