As a freshmen in Highschool I would spend time trying to re derive basic calculus rules.
These blog posts written a long time ago are writeup of these attempts. As I was very early on in my mathematical education and doing things on my own away from the help of the internet one can see a lot different minor mistakes.
These write ups are quite important to me as they were my first experience with derivation/proofs and began to teach me by doing what constitutes a proof and how to go about solving such questions.
