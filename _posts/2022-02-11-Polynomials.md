This post is the first in a sequence of 3 posts leading up to proving a famous result about Z/pZ \* being cyclic.

It was written when I was a new Junior in HS and I am now writing this extra excerpt as a sophomore in college.

In this post I show important results about how polynomials can still be factored in arbitrary felids, polynomial divisibility, and especially that Polynomials can have no more solutions than their degree.
