This post is the third in a sequence of 3 posts leading up to proving a famous result about Z/pZ \* being cyclic.

It was written when I was a new Junior in HS and I am now writing this extra excerpt as a sophomore in college.

In this post I prove that all finite field's multiplicative groups are cyclic and that all felids additive groups look like a vector space over Z/pZ
